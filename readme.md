# Kafka Project

This is a project to create a Spring Boot application using Kafka.

## Software needed

Needs a running zookeeper and kafka on port 9092

## Usage

Start the Spring-Boot project, then you can interact with the Customer API.


## Future Improvements

- using Avro instead of the Kafka serializer/deserializer
- creating a scheduler
- separate this project into two projects, one for both api's
